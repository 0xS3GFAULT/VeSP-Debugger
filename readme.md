# VeSP Language

VeSP (VEry Simple Processor) is a simple instruction set & simulator made by [A. Yavuz Oruc]([http://google.fr](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~yavuz/))

The VeSP simulator takes in machine code and runs it. There is no 'print' functionality, all data
is either in registers or memory. See [VeSP Documentation](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~yavuz/teaching/courses/enee350/vesp-source-code/vesp1.0.htm) for more info.
